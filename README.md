Latitude vs Temperature
As latitude increases, temperatures drop because there is less direct sunshine and therefore cities in this range of latitude face colder temperatures.  As latitude decreases, temperatures rise and therefore cities in that range of latitude have warmer temperatures.

There appears to be no obvious correlation comparing latitude with humidity and cloudiness.
